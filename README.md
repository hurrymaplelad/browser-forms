# Browser Forms

Constructing a good form by hand is a lot of work. 
Ruby on Rails and Django contain code to make this process less painful.
This module is an attempt to provide the same sort of helpers for browser-side js.
It builds on [caolan/forms](http://github.com/caolan/forms) to provide polished client-side interactions.

    npm install browser-forms
